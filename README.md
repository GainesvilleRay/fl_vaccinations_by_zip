Analysis of COVID-19 vaccinations in each Florida ZIP Code

This script creates a couple of csv files to help analyze data from the Florida Department of Health obtained by Gannett newspapers relating to COVID-19 vaccinations. The DOH data has non-identifiable individual records for each shot administered, including details for the ZIP Code of residence, the county where the shot was administered, the age range of the recipient, gender, date of first and second shots, and status of vaccination (complete or incomplete).

One csv file counts the number of shots for resdidents in each ZIP Code, including the county where the shot was administered.

Another csv file consolidates the various sites of administration, counting the total shots per ZIP Code, and adds in 2019 population estimates and some demographic detail, along with calculating the overall rate of vaccination.

The analysis was done by Douglas Ray, editor at The Gainesville Sun, doug.ray@starbanner.com.
